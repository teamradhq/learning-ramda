/** 
 * Name:       o
 * Category:   function
 * 
 * o is a curried composition function that returns a unary function.
 * Like compose, o performs right-to-left function composition.
 * Unlike compose, the rightmost function passed to o will be
 * invoked with only one argument. Also, unlike compose, o is
 * limited to accepting only 2 unary functions. The name o was chosen because
 * of its similarity to the mathematical composition operator âˆ˜.
 * 
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * const classyGreeting = name => "The name's " + name.last + ", " + name.first + " " + name.last
 * const yellGreeting = R.o(R.toUpper, classyGreeting);
 * yellGreeting({first: 'James', last: 'Bond'}); //=> "THE NAME'S BOND, JAMES BOND"
 * 
 * R.o(R.multiply(10), R.add(10))(-4) //=> 60
 * ```
 *

                pipe}
